GWLab Viterbi Python API
==================

`GWLab <https://gwlab.org.au/>`_ is a service used to handle both the submission of `Viterbi <https://pypi.org/project/bilby/>`_ jobs to a supercomputer queue and the obtaining of the results produced by these jobs.
While there is a web interface for this service, which is recommended for beginners, this package can be used to allow Viterbi job submission and manipulation from Python scripts.
